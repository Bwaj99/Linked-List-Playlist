This project is a playlist management system that allows users to create and manipulate playlists of songs. It organizes and interacts with a collection of songs to make a playlist. The project leverages key C++ principles such as object-oriented programming (OOP) and data encapsulation to encapsulate song details within PlaylistNode objects and manage them using the Playlist class. It also demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation and pointers to create and manipulate linked lists of songs. Additionally, the project provides a user-friendly command-line interface, illustrating C++ principles related to input/output handling, control flow, and modularization through the use of functions. Overall, it serves as a practical example of applying C++ concepts for creating a useful and interactive software system.
